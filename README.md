# Parallel-Port-Device-Driver-Nibble-Mode
A parallel port is an interface for connecting peripherals. The project aims at writing a device driver routine for 74LS244 parallel port and establish parallel communication in Nibble mode in which data is transferred in parallel form using only 4 data pins. The transfer occurs nibble by nibble between two devices.
